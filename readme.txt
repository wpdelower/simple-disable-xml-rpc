== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there an admin interface for this plugin? =

Yes. Please go to Settings > Simple Disable XML-RPC

= How do I know if the plugin is working? =

There are a few easy methods for checking if XML-RPC is off:

1. Try using an XML-RPC WordPress client, like the official WordPress mobile apps. The WordPress mobile app should tell you that "XML-RPC services are disabled on this site" if the plugin is activated.
2. Use the curl command to send an XML-RPC request to your site. If the response contains "XML-RPC services are disabled on this site" then the plugin is working properly and WordPress will not send data back to XML-RPC requests.
3. Try the XML-RPC Validator, written by Danilo Ercoli of the Automattic Mobile Team - the tool is available at [https://xmlrpc-check.hostpress.me/](https://xmlrpc-check.hostpress.me/). Information and source code for the tool are available on GitHub at [https://github.com/daniloercoli/WordPress-XML-RPC-Validator](https://github.com/daniloercoli/WordPress-XML-RPC-Validator). Keep in mind that you want the validator to fail and tell you that XML-RPC services are disabled.

See the screenshots for examples of what these tools will return when the plugin is enabled.
